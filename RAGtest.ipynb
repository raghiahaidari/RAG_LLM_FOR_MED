The Rif Mountains (Arabic for “edge of \\nthe cultivated area”) are Morocco’s northernmost mountain range, with their highest peak, Tidirhine, rising to a \\nlittle over 2,400 m (8,000 ft)  . This crescent-shaped mountain range rises sharply from the narrow coastal plain; it \\nruns parallel to the Mediterranean coast and ends near the town of Tétouan, in the Jebala massif  . The peaks are \\nsometimes covered in snow in the winter, but the mountains can get very hot during summer days  . Chefchaouen \\nis one of the Rif’s principal towns  .

This range rises close to the Atlantic coast and borders the Sahara \\nDesert  . Like in the Sahara, the land is barren, the climate is dry with annual precipitation of less than 200 mm \\n(7 .8 in), and the summer heat can be oppressive  . The villages in this range are less developed than those in other \\nmountain ranges  . Jebel Siroua, an ancient volcano, is a popular destination for mountain climbers  .12, 13, 14\\nHigh Atlas Mountains\\nThe High Atlas mountain range runs north of and parallel to the Anti-Atlas  . The peaks in the High Atlas, as the \\nname implies, soar the highest and include the country’s highest mountain, Mount Toubkal, at 4,165 m (13,664 \\nft), which is also the highest peak in North Africa  .

It stretches north of the High Atlas and south of the \\nRif Mountains  . Peaks in the Middle Atlas rise to about 3,000 m (9,842 ft)  . The mountains function as a climatic \\nbuffer between the moist ocean winds and the dry winds from the Sahara  .

The Gharb extends about 80 km (50 \\nmi) along the Atlantic coast and 110 km (70 mi) inland, where it meets the Rif Mountains  . The Gharb is crossed \\nby the Sebou River, which rises in the Middle Atlas and flows near Morocco’s third-largest city, Fès  .

Generally, the country can be divided \\ninto two climactic zones: the Mediterranean northern coastal regions and the southern interior regions, which \\nlie on the edge of the Sahara Desert  . Along the coasts, the climate is moderate and subtropical, cooled off by \\nbreezes from the Atlantic and Mediterranean  . In the interior, temperatures are more extreme with fairly cold \\nwinters and very hot summers  .31, 32\\nThe coast has a Mediterranean climate with dry, hot summers and wet winters that last from October to April  . \\nRainfall generally increases from south to north  . When high-pressure ridges develop and persist off the coast in \\nthe winter, even northern regions receive little rain, and drought conditions can occur  .33, 34\\nPrecipitation varies with elevation  . The coastal lowlands around the Gharb plain have 800 mm (32 in) of average \\nrainfall yearly, while in the Souss Valley it rains 200 mm (8 in) per year  . Farther south of the Anti-Atlas, where the \\nland becomes desert, rainfall is almost nonexistent  . In the mountains, yearly rainfall may be as heavy as 2,030 \\nmm (80 in) in the central Rif Mountains, dropping to 760 mm (30 in) in the High Atlas  . Snow falls in the mountains \\nabove 2,000 m (6,561 ft), and in the highest elevations the snowpack may last until late spring or early summer  .35 \\nSpring and summer temperatures are mild in the coastal regions because of onshore ocean breezes, but they \\ncan reach 35˚C (95˚F) inland. During the summer, hot, dry sharqi  winds from the Sahara can sweep over the \\nmountains, raising temperatures dramatically, even along the coast  . These winds can severely dry out unharvested \\ncrops. Average coastal temperatures in the winter range from 8–17˚C (46–63˚F). Inland temperatures can drop \\nsignificantly and occasionally fall below freezing  .36 Due to climate change, recent trends show that the frequency \\nof days and nights classified as “hot” has increased significantly  .37\\n28  Encyclopædia Britannica , “Draa River,” 24 September 2007, https://www  .britannica  .com/place/Draa-River  \\n29  J .

Rome maintained its presence in the region by keeping \\nsmall garrisons manned by local soldiers. Roman influence remained mostly in the northwest of present-day \\nMorocco.17, 18, 19 \\nNorth Africa was under Roman rule for nearly 500 years. Greek and Roman historians referred to the native \\npopulation as “Libyans,” “Africans,” Numidians,” and “Moors,” and classified them as “barbarians” ( barbaroi ), \\na name that was later adopted by the Arab conquerors.20 Many Berbers today reject the name because of the \\nnegative connotation, and insist on being called Amazigh (plural Imazighen), which means “free people” in the \\nindigenous language Tamazight.

Idriss I unified much of northern Morocco under Islamic rule before his \\ndeath by poisoning in 793.42, 43 \\nHis son, Idriss II (793–828), extended control into Europe. He established Fès in 808 as the capital and founded \\nthe world’s oldest university, Al-Qarawiyyin University. Later, he divided his kingdom among his sons. The smaller \\nkingdoms warred against one another and broke up.44, 45 In 985, The last Idrisid switched allegiance to the Fatamids \\nand was deposed and executed by the caliphate of Cordoba.46\\nThe Almoravids (1056–1147) \\nIn the southwestern part of the country, a stricter form of Islam emerged under Yahya ibn Ibrahim, chief of the \\nSanhaja tribe.

Because \\ntheir rulers had no ties to the Prophet Muhammad, they met resistance in their capital, Fès, where many residents \\nclaimed Idrisid ancestry. To compensate for the lack of religion, the Marinids established madrassas (Quranic \\nschools) in urban centers. They also waged campaigns to regain parts of the Almohad dynasty in Spain and the \\neastern Maghreb, but their territorial gains were temporary.56, 57\\nThe decentralized Marinid dynasty began unraveling in the second half of the 14th century. Marinid rulers were \\nkilled or deposed frequently during this period.58, 59 Under Sultan Mohammed al-Saih al-Mahdi, the Watas tribe \\nseized power after a revolt in 1465, ushering in the Wattasid dynasty, which lasted until the mid-1500s.60, 61\\nThe Wattasids and Saadians\\nAlthough the Wattasids were the nominal rulers, they controlled only Fès. In 1492, when the Spanish monarchs \\nexpelled Arabs and Jews from Spain, many fled to Morocco. The influx of wealth and new ideas fundamentally \\nimpacted Moroccan culture.62\\nThe Wattasid period witnessed the beginning of European incursions into Morocco. The Portuguese arrived in \\n1415 and established garrison forts in several Atlantic ports. The city of Mazagan (El Jadida) was one of the first \\nfortified colonies that Portuguese explorers of the Atlantic coast established in Africa. In 2004, Mazagan was \\nadded to the UNESCO World Heritage list.63, 64\\nUnable to repel the Portuguese, the Wattasids pursued cooperation. Other indigenous tribes viewed appeasement \\nof the Portuguese as an affront to Islam, and a war broke out in 1536 between the two most powerful tribes, the \\nWattasids, and the Saadians.65\\nA settlement gave the Saadians control of Marrakech.

Believing that closer ties with Europe would \\nimprove Morocco’s security and economic strength, the early Alaouite rulers formed alliances and established \\nembassies in several European nations.67, 68, 69\\nThese efforts did not protect Morocco from foreign intervention. The country had to turn over some of its land \\nto Spain and France in return for favors, including help from Spain in quelling an insurrection by the indigenous \\nRif tribes. The strategic importance of Morocco was clear to other nations, who also wanted to gain a foothold.70\\nDuring the first three decades of the 19th century, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Sulaiman isolated Morocco from \\nChristian Europe. Trade with the northern neighbors was limited, and the Europeans who lived in the country were \\nconfined to the port cities.71, 72\\nEuropean Encroachment and Colonial Takeover\\nIn the mid-19th century, Morocco, which had never been incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, became a target \\nfor enterprising European colonialists. In 1844, in retaliation for Morocco’s support of the rebel Algerian emir \\nAbdel Kader, the French navy shelled the ports of Tangier and Mogador (Essaouira). The French went on to defeat \\nthe Moroccan army in the Battle of Isly, near the northwestern Moroccan-Algerian border.73 A Franco-Moroccan \\ntreaty was hastily negotiated in which Morocco agreed to cut off assistance to the emir. In 1859, a dispute over \\nthe Ceuta enclave propelled Spain to declare war and occupy the northern city of Tétouan; in 1884, Spain created \\na protectorate in the coastal areas.74, 75, 76\\nEuropean influence—most notably French, Spanish, and British—increased dramatically toward the end of the \\n19th century. France, in particular, aggressively pursued colonial interests in Morocco.77 In 1904, the French and \\nBritish reached an agreement that relinquished French rights and interests in Egypt in exchange for Britain’s \\nabdication of Morocco. A few months later, the French and Spanish negotiated an agreement outlining their \\nspheres of influence in Morocco.78, 79, 80\\n67  History World, “History of Morocco,” n.d., http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ac97  \\n68  Kevin Delgado, Modern Nations of the World: Morocco (New York: Lucent Books, 2006), 37–38.\\n69  Encyclopedia.com, “Alawite Dynasty,” 2004, https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-\\nand-maps/alawite-dynasty  \\n70  Kevin Delgado, Modern Nations of the World: Morocco (New York: Lucent Books, 2006), 38–39.\\n71  Jamil M.

In 1912, Moulay Hafiz signed a treaty \\nmaking most of Morocco a French protectorate.

The medinas, or walled quarters, of the major cities, were retained, with nouvelles \\nvilles  (modern cities) built adjacent to them for the French.

Roosevelt met in a suburb \\nof Casablanca to confer on global military strategy against the Axis powers.102 While in Morocco, Roosevelt and \\nSultan Mohammed V discussed Morocco’s future, with Roosevelt expressing support for Moroccan independence \\nfrom France.103, 104 Later that year, the Hizb al-Istiglal (Independence Party) was formed, and its leaders soon \\ncalled for an end to French rule.105, 106\\nAfter the war, the French reclaimed control of Morocco, but persistent calls for independence by the Hizb al-\\nIstiglal, supported by the sultan, threatened their authority.

Eventually, these claims led to violent \\ndissent that threatened the king’s rule.

In response, King Hassan II called to stage a peaceful march to the province. \\nOn November 6, the government organized a mass demonstration in which 350,000 unarmed men and women \\nmarched into Western Sahara with the purpose to free the region from the remaining Spanish rule.125, 126 This event \\nwas labeled the “Green March” by Hassan II because of the historical association of the color green with Islam. \\n“The Green March” was a significant event in the country’s history and is commemorated on 6 November every \\nyear.

Tourism is one of the pillars of the Moroccan economy.8, 9, 10\\nEconomic diversification into the automotive, electronics, chemistry, and aerospace industries has helped the \\ncountry reduce its dependence on the agricultural sector.11 \\nA major weakness in the economy is the shortage of energy sources, as Morocco imports most of its energy.

Irrigated land is just 16% of cultivated land, yet generates 75% of agricultural exports and \\nhalf of agricultural GDP. The majority of farms are small—about 70% of farmers cultivate fewer than five hectares \\nand occupy a quarter of the total land under cultivation—and produce mostly food for local markets or for the \\nfarmers’ consumption.17, 18, 19\\nCereal crops occupy 75% of arable land and include wheat, barley, rice, sorghum, and corn for animal feed. A \\nsmall portion of the land is sown with pulses (legumes) such as soybean, peas, chickpeas, and lentils.

Since then, the Arab and Berber ethnic groups have assimilated. \\nToday, most Moroccans claim both Arab and Berber descent. Only a few Arabs, such as the Shereefs (Oulad Ali), \\nwho trace their ancestry back to Prophet Muhammad and have the title “Moulay,” claim to be “pure” Arabs.32, 33\\nMoroccan Arabs dominate the professional class. The Alaouites (or ʿAlawī), Morocco’s royal family and self-\\nproclaimed descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, are the wealthiest and most powerful group.34\\nArabs follow the Quran more strictly than Berbers. The Quran defines gender roles—men are the providers, and \\nwomen take care of the household. However, even among Arabs, these traditional divisions vary. Traditions run \\ndeep among fundamentalists; greater openness exists among wealthier Arabs.35\\nMoroccan Arabic, known as Darija, is the first language of most Arab Moroccans apart from the regions where \\nBerber languages dominate. Modern Standard Arabic is typically used for official business. Darija is a spoken \\nlanguage used in family settings, between friends, by shopkeepers, in offices, by cab drivers, on the television, \\netc. Darija is very similar to the Arabic spoken in Algeria, and to a lesser extent, the Arabic of Tunisia and Libya. \\nArabic speakers outside of the Maghreb find Darija difficult to understand, although Moroccans can understand \\nspeakers from the Arabian Peninsula. The Darija vocabulary comes from Arabic and Tamazight, but many words \\nin French, Spanish, English, German, and Portuguese have penetrated this dialect.  Lastly, many idiomatic sayings \\nand slang words in Darija are not easily understood outside of Morocco.36 \\nIn Western Sahara, people speak a version of Arabic called Hassaniya , which has replaced Berber languages that \\nwere spoken in the region . Hassaniya has a few dialects and was influenced by the West African-based Zenaga \\nand Wolof languages.37, 38\\nJews\\nA Jewish population has been present in Morocco for nearly 2,000 years, and Moroccan Jews have held important \\npositions in the government and the business community—Jews had a monopoly on sugar exports and played \\na key role in the caravan trade.39 Jewish neighborhoods ( mellahs ) existed in Casablanca, Fez, Marrakech, Rabat, \\nMogador, Meknes, and Tangier. During World War II, King Hassan refused to cooperate with France’s Vichy \\ngovernment demand to deport Jews to European concentration camps. Since the foundation of the state of \\nIsrael, the Jewish community in Morocco had shrunk from about 260,000 in 1948 to just a few thousand today, \\nwith about 2,500 Jews living in Casablanca.

Today, the Sahrawi are known as \\nthe “people of the Sahara.” This formerly nomadic group has become more settled because of the danger of \\nmovement during armed conflicts.56, 57\\nThe Sahrawi  have a well-defined caste system. The highest caste members study and teach Islam or are warriors. \\nThe second caste comprises craftsmen and artisans. Traditionally, the lowest caste members were black slaves, \\nand although slavery has been outlawed, darker-skinned Sahrawi face discrimination. The Sahrawi have the \\nhighest level of gender equality among all groups in the country. Although Arabs have tried to acculturate them, \\nthe Sahrawi have successfully preserved much of their culture.58\\nReligion\\nIslam is the state religion of Morocco, and 99% of the people follow Sunni Islam. Despite the special status of \\nIslam, the constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Religious minorities can openly practice their faiths but \\nare not allowed to proselytize. Voluntary conversion is not a crime. Christian and Jewish minorities have small \\npopulations. A majority of the country’s estimated 4,000 Jews live in Casablanca.  Estimates for the Christian \\npopulation, which is mostly made up of expatriates living in Casablanca and Rabat, range from 2,000 to 50,000.59\\nSunni Islam and Judaism are the only religions recognized in the constitution as native to the country; other faiths \\nare viewed as foreign. Jews have special courts that govern personal matters such as marriage and divorce, and \\na separate set of civil laws. Throughout its history, Morocco has considered itself a bastion of religious tolerance \\nin the Arab and Islamic worlds, and the monarchy has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to the safety of \\nthe Jewish minority.60, 61\\nAfter the 2003 Casablanca bombing, concern about the rise of jihadist ideology and the spread of Hanbali \\nWahhabism,  in Morocco and throughout Africa, drove the government to pursue a more moderate and balanced \\nform of Islam called al-wasatiyya ( “the middle path”). Government officials advocate for this distinct Moroccan \\nIslam—besides affirming that there is only one Islam—based on three principles: the Maliki school of law \\n(maddhab ), Ashari theology ( kalâm ), and Sunni Sufism ( tassawûf ).62 \\nMuslim judges are trained in the Maliki-Ashari Sunni interpretation of Sharia law, but some Maliki rulings have \\nextended legal interpretations to encompass local traditions.

In rural areas, \\nthe marabouts  often take on the role of arbitrators because of their prestige. Sultans and kings, being shurafa  \\n(descendants of the Prophet Muhammad), have also traditionally possessed baraka.

Ingredients \\nused routinely in Moroccan cooking are preserved lemons, olives, figs, dates, sesame seeds, and almonds. Beef \\nis less common than seafood, fish, lamb, mutton, and poultry. Arabs introduced Moroccans to cinnamon, ginger, \\ncumin, saffron, and caraway. Other spices used in Moroccan cooking are paprika, turmeric, cayenne, black \\npepper, and anise seeds.69 \\nMorocco’s national dish is couscous or seksu , made from fine semolina wheat and served with meat, chicken, \\nseafood or vegetable stew. Couscous may also be made from barley, wheat, corn, and millet. It can be garnished \\nwith a sweet raisin preserve, or in the Berber tradition, with a bowl of buttermilk. Couscous is eaten by everyone \\nand is the most common food in Morocco.70, 71, 72\\nHarira  is a basic Moroccan dish. It is a thick, spicy soup made with tomatoes, lentils, chickpeas, and lamb, topped \\nwith a squeeze of lemon juice and chopped coriander. The soup is served with a sweet pretzel called chebakkiya . \\nThis soup is commonly eaten in the evening and as the first meal when the sun goes down during Ramadan.73, 74\\nAnother Moroccan signature dish is tajine , a stew made with lamb or poultry mixed with almonds, hard-boiled eggs, \\nprunes, lemons, and tomatoes, and spiced with saffron, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, and ground red pepper. \\nThis stew is named after the distinctive dish in which it is cooked and served—an earthenware pot with a cone-shaped \\ntop.

Not all Moroccan \\nwomen wear the abaya , but many cover up when they are outside the home. The hijab  is a type of head covering \\nMuslim women use. This fitted scarf comes in different colors and sometimes matches the color of the abaya . The \\nmost concealing garments are the niqab  and the burqa , which conceal the entire body and face.93 \\nWestern-style clothing, such as jeans and T-shirts, are becoming more popular, especially among young people. \\nSome women wear cosmetics in moderation — a woman with too much makeup risks being interpreted as \\nsignaling an invitation to men.94 \\nGender Issues\\nMorocco’s 2011 constitution recognizes gender equality in civil, political, economic, cultural, and environmental \\naffairs, but the law favors men; discrimination against women continues today. Women are entitled to receive only \\nhalf the inheritance that their male counterparts would receive under similar circumstances. In rural areas, women \\ncannot own land, which leaves them vulnerable to displacement and poverty. Equal pay for equal work is required \\nby law but is not enforced.95, 96\\nThe reformed family code, or Moudawana , of 2004, initiated by King Mohammed VI, increased women’s rights in \\nareas of marriage, divorce, and child custody. It eliminated the requirement of a matrimonial guardian (typically \\nthe father or a surrogate) for a woman to marry and placed the family under joint responsibility. The reforms raised \\nthe age of marriage for girls from 15 to 18 and established the right to divorce by mutual consent, thus giving \\nwomen the right to divorce on the same grounds as men. Men’s right to divorce their wives by repudiation—the \\ntriple talaq,  or saying “I divorce you” three times—now falls under judicial control and has to be approved by a \\njudge. Although polygamy is still legal, it has become so restricted that it is nearly impossible. These and other \\nprovisions of the Moudawana  gave Morocco one of the most progressive family codes in the Arab world.97, 98\\nIn 2009, women became members of municipal councils for the first time, and in the 2016 elections, women won \\n21% of the seats in the House of Representatives.

Chaabi is the pop music of Morocco. \\nIt evolved from Moroccan folk music and sounds similar to Rai, a form of folk music that originated in Algeria. \\nGnawa combines hypnotic trance rhythms with ceremonial dancing and acrobatics. The music came to Morocco \\nwith West African slaves and evolved in Marrakech.104, 105, 106 \\nBerber music is played with drums (bendir), flutes (nair), clarinets, and a rabab, a one-stringed fiddle. The music leaves \\nconsiderable room for improvisation and for unexpected instruments, such as bagpipes or oboes (ghaita), but the \\nrhythms and lyrics always have traditional elements. Often there is a call-and-response motif, in which the lead singer \\nposes a question and a female chorus responds. Professional groups of musicians, called imdyazn, travel during the \\nsummer and perform in village squares and in weekly markets. Sufi music can be heard in religious rituals honoring \\nSufi holy men. Sufi music and dance are regarded by its followers as a way to get closer to God.107, 108, 109\\nMoroccan Arab-Andalusian classical orchestras play compositions written in the 10th–15th centuries in Andalusia \\n(southern Spain). The lyrics are in classical Arabic or the Andalusian dialect, and the complex music is played with \\ninstruments rarely used in non-Muslim countries.

For example, Islamist political parties harshly criticized the \\nacclaimed 2006 film Marock, which involves a relationship between a Jewish boy and a Muslim girl.119\\nAl-Halqa\\nAl-halqa  is a unique, centuries-old form of street theater performed in the central squares of many Moroccan \\ncities. The huge central square of Marrakech, Djemaa al-Fna, is known for its vast array of halaqi  (entertainers). \\nEach halaqi  is surrounded by an audience, so within a short distance, a spectator can hear the elaborate tales of \\nstorytellers, see the ancient art of snake charming, or watch the undulations of crossdressing belly dancers. The \\ncultural importance of al-Halqa  was underscored by UNESCO in 2001 when the Djemaa al-Fna became the first \\nWorld Heritage Site for oral history and tradition.120, 121, 122\\nFolk Culture and Folklore\\nFor more than 40 years, Marrakech has hosted the annual Marrakech Festival of Popular Arts, which showcases \\nBerber culture. The Marrakech festival has preserved many Berber traditions, primarily for the benefit of tourists. \\nOne such tradition is the fantasia, a horsemanship exhibition in which warring Berber horsemen in flowing robes \\ncharge on horseback and discharge weapons in unison.123 \\nMorocco’s numerous rural moussems  (celebrations) play a similar role for Berbers. The Imilchil Marriage Festival \\nis a well-known moussem  that takes place in the Middle Atlas village of Imilchil, where Berbers have converged \\nto trade, sing, and dance for years. Young Berber men and women go there to find marriage partners.124, 125, 126\\n115  Liza Foreman, “Hollywood In Morocco: The Film Studios At The End of the World,” Daily Beast, 10 January 2015, https://www.\\nthedailybeast.com/hollywood-in-morocco-the-film-studios-at-the-end-of-the-world  \\n116  Friendly Morocco, “Top 10 Kasbahs (Fortress) in Morocco,” n.d., https://friendlymorocco.com/top-10/top-10-kasbahs-fortress-\\nin-morocco/  \\n117  Michael Turtle, “Atlas Studios, Ouarzazate, Morocco,” Time Travel Turtle, n.d., https://www.timetravelturtle.com/atlas-studios-\\nouarzazate-morocco/  \\n118  Festival Marrakech, “International Film Festival Marrakech,” 2019, http://www.festivalmarrakech.info/en/  \\n119  Sarah Gauch and Ursula Lindsey, “Two Arab Movies Push the Bounds of Cultural Candor,” Christian Science Monitor , 14 June \\n2006, http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0614/p01s04-wome.html  \\n120  Mounir Haissour, “Al-Halqa: A Folk Drama that Mirrors the Moroccan Society in Crisis,” Moroccan Times, 6 September 2016, \\nhttp://themoroccantimes.com/2016/09/20629/al-halqa-a-folk-drama-that-mirrors-the-moroccan-society-in-crisis-haissour  \\n121  Jaouad Radouani, “The Art of Halqa, Site-Specificity, and Moroccan Cultural Identity (Part I),” Morocco World News, 12 February \\n2016, https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/02/179676/the-art-of-halqa-site-specificity-and-moroccan-cultural-identity-\\npart-i/  \\n122  UNESCO, “Cultural Space of Jemaa el-Fna Square,” n.d., https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/cultural-space-of-jemaa-el-fna-\\nsquare-00014  \\n123  Amiee Maxwell, “Marrakech Popular Arts Festival,” Journey Beyond Travel, n.d., https://www.journeybeyondtravel.com/blog/'),\n",

In 1960, newly independent Mauritania claimed parts of Western Sahara. After Spain ceded \\nthe southern third of Western Sahara to Mauritania in 1975, a costly war against the Polisario Front threatened \\nto cripple Mauritania’s economy. In 1979, after Mauritania signed a peace treaty with the Polisario Front and \\nrenounced its territorial claims in Western Sahara, Morocco annexed Mauritania’s portion. That year, Mauritania \\nrecognized the Polisario Front as the sole legitimate representative of the people of Western Sahara but did not \\nrecognize the SADR.39, 40\\nRelations between the two countries reached a low point in the early 1980s after pro-Moroccan members of an \\nopposition group attempted to topple the government of Mauritania in March of 1981. Morocco in return accused \\nMauritania of harboring Polisario fighters. In 1984, after Mauritania recognized SADR, Morocco moved its troops \\nto Mauritania’s northern border, only 4 km (2.5 mi) from Mauritania’s key economic center at Nouâdhibou.41\\nIn 1985, the two countries restored relations and opened a border crossing in Guerguerat, which is located \\nbetween southern Western Sahara and the Mauritanian port of Nouâdhibou.42, 43\\n32  Aljazeera, “UN Envoy: ‘Peaceful Solution’ to Western Sahara Conflict Possible,” 6 December 2018, https://www.aljazeera.com/\\nnews/2018/12/envoy-peaceful-solution-western-sahara-conflict-181206164240438.html  \\n33  Middle East Monitor, “King Mohammed: Morocco, Algeria Tensions Are Unreasonable,” 7 November 2018, https://www.\\nmiddleeastmonitor.com/20181107-king-mohammed-morocco-algeria-tensions-are-unreasonable/  \\n34  Anouar Boukhars, “Barriers Versus Smugglers: Algeria and Morocco’s Battle for Border Security,” Carnegie Endowment for \\nInternational Peace, 19 March 2019, https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/03/19/barriers-versus-smugglers-algeria-and-\\nmorocco-s-battle-for-border-security-pub-78618  \\n35  Aljazeera, “UN Envoy: ‘Peaceful Solution’ to Western Sahara Conflict Possible,” 6 December 2018, https://www.aljazeera.com/\\nnews/2018/12/envoy-peaceful-solution-western-sahara-conflict-181206164240438.html  \\n36  Stéphanie Fillion, “The US Is Driving the New Talks on Western Sahara, Involving Morocco and Algeria,” PassBlue, 2 December \\n2018, https://www.passblue.com/2018/12/02/the-us-is-driving-the-new-talks-on-western-sahara-involving-morocco-and-algeria/  \\n37  Mohamed Chtatou, “Morocco and Algeria: The Endless Cold War,” International Policy Digest, 19 December 2018, https://\\nintpolicydigest.org/2018/12/19/morocco-and-algeria-the-endless-cold-war/  \\n38  Middle East Monitor, “King Mohammed: Morocco, Algeria Tensions Are Unreasonable,” 7 November 2018, https://www.\\nmiddleeastmonitor.com/20181107-king-mohammed-morocco-algeria-tensions-are-unreasonable/  \\n39  Rachel Warner, “The Haidalla Regime,” in A Country Study: Mauritania , ed.

The proposed sale intends to upgrade Morocco’s self-defense capabilities.97\\nRoyal Moroccan Navy\\nThe smallest of Morocco’s military branches, the Royal Moroccan Navy and Coast Guard is a trim but a well-\\nequipped force with 120 naval assets, protecting Morocco’s 1,835 km (1,140 mi) of coastline.98 Morocco’s two \\nnaval infantry battalions are served by 6 multipurpose frigates, corvettes, a few dozen patrol/strike boats, and 9 \\namphibian transport vessels. Among the navy’s tasks is the interdiction of vessels trafficking in drugs and illegal \\nimmigrants in the Strait of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea. Bases are located at Casablanca (headquarters), \\nAgadir, al-Hoceima, Dakhla, Kenitra, Ksar al-Seghir, Safi, and Tangier.99, 100\\nIssues Affecting Stability\\nWestern Sahara and SADR\\nWestern Sahara is considered a non-self-governing territory by the United Nations.101 The Saharan Arab Democratic \\nRepublic (SADR), which covers about 20% of Western Sahara’s territory, was declared by the Polisario Front in \\n1976 and is recognized by several UN members. SADR is a full member of the African Union. Between 100,000 \\nand 200,000 Sahrawi refugees live in camps near the western Algerian town of Tindouf, near the Moroccan and \\nWestern Sahara borders. Tindouf is the main base of the Polisario Front.102, 103, 104, 105\\nThe conflict between Morocco and the Polisario Front is a cause of continuous security concerns.

Rome maintained its presence in the region by keeping \\nsmall garrisons manned by local soldiers. Roman influence remained mostly in the northwest of present-day \\nMorocco.17, 18, 19 \\nNorth Africa was under Roman rule for nearly 500 years. Greek and Roman historians referred to the native \\npopulation as “Libyans,” “Africans,” Numidians,” and “Moors,” and classified them as “barbarians” ( barbaroi ), \\na name that was later adopted by the Arab conquerors.20 Many Berbers today reject the name because of the \\nnegative connotation, and insist on being called Amazigh (plural Imazighen), which means “free people” in the \\nindigenous language Tamazight. Some Berbers, however, do not identify as Amazigh. 21\\nChristianity began to spread in the region during the 2nd century CE, and by the end of the 4th century, most \\nsettled areas had largely converted.22 In the mountains and desert regions, Christianity competed with traditional \\ntribal beliefs and Judaism.23 \\nThe Vandals (429–533)\\nRoman rule over North Africa was disrupted in 429, when Germanic tribes from central Europe known as Vandals \\ninvaded North Africa from Spain, seized Hippo Regius (modern Annaba in Algeria), and made it their first capital \\nin North Africa. With the Romans no longer around, several independent Amazigh kingdoms were established in \\nthe mountains and inland deserts.24, 25, 26\\nByzantine Rule (533–700)\\nIn 533, the Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) general Belisarius landed in present-day Tunisia with an army that \\nquickly vanquished the Vandal plunderers and brought North Africa once again under nominal Roman imperial \\ncontrol. During much of the next century, the Byzantines were preoccupied with military campaigns, allowing \\nAmazigh kingdoms to thrive in the hinterlands.27, 28\\n17  Graham Land, “The Marvel of North Africa During Roman Times,” History Hit, 24 July 2018, https://www.historyhit.com/the-\\nmarvel-of-north-africa-during-roman-times/  \\n18  Fodors Travel, “The Romans in Morocco,” n.d., https://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-east/morocco/the-northern-\\natlantic-coast/experiences/the-romans-in-morocco-267072340  \\n19  Facts and Details, “Berbers and North Africa in the Roman Era,” n.d., http://factsanddetails.com/world/cat55/sub394/entry-5932.\\nhtml#chapter-6  \\n20  Bruce Maddy-Weitzman, “Berbers and the Nation-State in North Africa,” Oxford Research Encyclopedias , July 2017, http://\\noxfordre.com/africanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-105\\n21  Nuunja Kahina, “Free People: The Imazighen of North Africa,” Intercontinental Cry, 12 March 2013, https://intercontinentalcry.\\norg/free-people-the-imazighen-of-north-africa/  \\n22  Helen Chapan Metz, ed., Algeria: A Country Study (Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1994), http://countrystudies.us/\\nalgeria/6.htm  \\n23  Tony Zurlo, “2: Many Masters: History to the Nineteenth Century,” in Algeria  (Detroit: Lucent Books, 2005), 22.\\n24  Helen Chapan Metz, ed., Algeria: A Country Study (Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1994), http://countrystudies.us/\\nalgeria/7.htm  \\n25  Barnaby Rogerson, “Chapter 8: Bishops, Barbarians, and Byzantium, 400–647,” in A Traveller’s History of North Africa , 2nd ed. \\n(New York: Interlink Books, 2001), 104.\\n26  Encyclopœdia Britannica , “Vandal,” 11 February 2019, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vandal-Germanic-people  \\n27  Tony Zurlo, “2: Many Masters: History to the Nineteenth Century,” in Algeria  (Detroit: Lucent Books, 2005), 22.\\n28  Helen Chapan Metz, ed., Algeria: A Country Study (Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1994), http://countrystudies.us/\\nalgeria/6.htm'),\n",
